# Attack Vectors: Burp Exporter

This Burp Suite extension exports traffic, issues, and other Burp project data into structured formats suitable for ingestion into data lakes and vector databases — such as OpenSearch, Qdrant, and Weaviate.

By externalizing Burp's insights into searchable, semantically indexed stores, this extension enables advanced querying, cross-project correlation, and integration with agentic pentesting workflows — allowing autonomous or assisted systems to reason over historical findings, surface patterns, and drive automated recon and exploitation logic.
