# Attack Vectors: Burp Exporter

This Burp Suite extension continuously exports traffic, issues, and other project data into structured formats optimized for ingestion by data lakes and vector databases, such as OpenSearch, Qdrant, and Weaviate.

By externalizing Burpâ€™s insights into searchable, semantically indexed stores, this extension enables advanced querying, cross-project correlation, and integration with agentic pentesting workflows. This allows autonomous or assisted systems to reason over historical findings, surface patterns, and drive automated reconnaissance and exploitation logic.
